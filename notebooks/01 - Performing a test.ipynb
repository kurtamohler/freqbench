    "This function creates a frequency sweep signal, which is basically just a sine wave that starts out at some frequency, `freq0`, and speeds up or slows down over time to end up at some other frequency, `freq1`. In this case, we're sweeping from 0 Hz to 22 kHz to cover slightly more than the audible range of frequencies, which is about 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The signal will span over 10 seconds, indicated by the `time` argument. We also have to define a frame rate for the signal. 44.1 kHz is a typical audio frame rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last detail is that we're scaling the signal by `0.1`. This is because `freqbench.signal.sweep()` generates a signal at the maximum amplitude that digital audio signals can encode. Using the maximum amplitude will most likely create distortion and clipping, so we decrease it."

    "We have a test signal, and now we want to run it through the DUT. But first, it's important to recognize that we'll actually need to run two different tests before generating the frequency response. We already know that we need to capture the output signal from the DUT while we pipe the test signal through it, but we also need to capture the signal that we get when the DUT is taken out of the circuit. This is because the audio interface itself has a frequency response, so we can't just compare the output of the DUT directly with `test_signal`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first capture the base signal by removing the DUT from the circuit, and plugging the output of the audio interface directly into the input. Alternatively, if your DUT has a true bypass mode, you can just switch into that mode without unplugging anything. Now let's run a base signal test with `freqbench.run()`.
